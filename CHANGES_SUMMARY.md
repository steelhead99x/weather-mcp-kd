# Deployment Fix - Changes Summary

## Issue
Application was failing to start on Digital Ocean with:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/app/backend/src/index.ts'
```

## Root Cause
Digital Ocean was running the development command which tries to execute TypeScript source files that don't exist in the production container (only compiled JavaScript exists).

## Files Changed

### 1. backend/package.json
**Changed**: `start` script to be environment-aware
```json
"start": "if [ \"$NODE_ENV\" = \"production\" ]; then node dist/index.js; else npm run dev; fi"
```
- Now checks NODE_ENV and runs the correct command
- Works in both development and production environments

### 2. backend/start.sh (NEW)
**Created**: Robust startup script with diagnostics
- Validates environment and file structure
- Provides detailed error messages
- Ensures correct command execution based on NODE_ENV

### 3. Dockerfile
**Changed**: Updated to use the startup script
- Copies and makes executable the start.sh script
- Changed CMD from `["npm", "run", "start:production"]` to `["./start.sh"]`
- More reliable startup with better error handling

### 4. Dockerfile.simple
**Changed**: Updated to use the startup script
- Copies and makes executable the start.sh script
- Changed CMD from `["npm", "run", "start:production"]` to `["./start.sh"]`
- Consistent with main Dockerfile

### 5. .do/app.yaml (NEW)
**Created**: Digital Ocean App Platform specification
- Explicitly sets run command: `npm run start`
- Configures NODE_ENV=production
- Defines health check at `/health`
- Sets up proper instance sizing and monitoring

### 6. DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md (NEW)
**Created**: Complete deployment troubleshooting guide
- Explains the problem and solution
- Documents all deployment options
- Provides verification steps
- Includes rollback instructions

## How It Works Now

1. **Docker Container Starts** → Sets `NODE_ENV=production`
2. **Startup Script Executes** → Validates environment and files
3. **Production Check** → Detects `NODE_ENV=production`
4. **Correct Command** → Runs `node dist/index.js` (compiled code)
5. **Server Starts** → Health check responds at `/health`

## Next Steps

### To Deploy
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to your main branch
3. Digital Ocean will automatically deploy
4. Monitor the logs for successful startup

### To Verify Locally
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
NODE_ENV=production npm run start
# Or: NODE_ENV=production ./start.sh
```

### If Using Digital Ocean UI
1. Go to App Settings → Components → backend
2. Verify Run Command is: `npm run start`
3. Verify Environment Variables include: `NODE_ENV=production`
4. Save and redeploy

## Benefits of This Fix

✅ **Robust**: Multiple layers of validation and error handling  
✅ **Flexible**: Works in development and production  
✅ **Diagnostic**: Clear error messages when something goes wrong  
✅ **Standard**: Uses npm scripts that work everywhere  
✅ **Explicit**: Configuration is visible and documented  

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, you can quickly rollback:
1. Change run command to `npm run start:production`
2. Or revert the package.json changes
3. Redeploy

The application will work either way, but the new approach is more robust.
